        <h2>What is AI</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a field of computer science that focuses on
        creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence,
        such as understanding natural language, recognizing objects, or making decisions. Unlike
        traditional programming, where the programmer writes specific instructions for the computer
        o follow, AI systems use algorithms that allow them to learn from data and make predictions
        or decisions based on that learning.</p>
        <p>One example of AI in action is image recognition software used by social media platforms to
        automatically tag people in photos. Instead of being programmed to recognize specific faces,
        the software uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in the pixels of the image
        and identify faces based on those patterns. This approach allows the software to recognize faces
        it has never seen before and adapt to new images over time.</p>

    <section id="types" class="content">
        <h2>Types of AI</h2>
        <p>There are three main types of AI:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rule-Based Systems</li>
            <li>Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Deep Learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Rule-based systems</strong> are the simplest type of AI, where a set of predefined rules are used to make decisions. For example,
       a spam filter that flags emails containing certain words or phrases.</p> <p><strong> Machine learning </strong>is a more advanced type of AI,
        where algorithms are trained on large amounts of data to make predictions or classifications. For example,
        a recommendation system that suggests products based on a user's past purchases.</p><p><strong>Deep learning</strong> is the most complex type of AI,
        where neural networks are used to learn from vast amounts of data and make highly accurate predictions. For example,
        a self-driving car that uses deep learning to recognize objects and make driving decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="type1" class="content">
        <h2>Rule-based system</h2>
        <p>Rule-based artificial intelligence applies pre-set rules and guidelines to make
          determinations and reach conclusions.
A rule-based system uses human-defined rules to solve problems or make decisions. These systems are widely used in different
fields, such as AI, expert systems, and business logic.</p>
<p style="color: Black  ; font-size: 18px">Rule-based systems are a type of artificial intelligence that operates on a set of predefined rules.
    Here are some examples of rule-based systems:
    <ul>
      <li>Expert systems that provide advice or make decisions based on a set of rules and a knowledge base.</li>
      <li>Spam filters that use rules to identify and filter out unwanted messages in email inboxes.</li>
      <li>Fraud detection systems that use rules to identify suspicious behavior patterns in financial transactions.</li>
      <li>Voice assistants that use rules to understand and respond to voice commands.</li>
      <li>Diagnosis systems that use rules to identify and suggest treatments for medical conditions.</li>
      <li>Traffic control systems that use rules to manage traffic flow and avoid accidents.</li>
      <li>Decision support systems that use rules to provide recommendations or options to users.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    </section>

    <section id="type2" class="content">
        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a type of AI that enables computer systems to learn and improve from
          experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms on large datasets to recognize patterns
          and make predictions based on that data. One example of machine learning in day-to-day life is email spam filters, which
          use machine learning algorithms to identify and block unwanted messages. Another example is voice assistants like Siri or
           Alexa, which use machine learning to understand natural language commands.</p>
        <p>One advantage of machine learning is its ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately.
        This makes it useful for tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
        However, there are also limitations to machine learning. For example, it requires large amounts of high-quality
        data to train algorithms effectively. Additionally, machine learning models can be biased if the data used to train
        them is not diverse enough.</p>
        <p>Examples of machine learning include:
          <li>Image recognition</li>
          <li>Natural language processing</li>
          <li>Recommendation systems</li>
          <li>Predictive analytics</li>
          <li>Anomaly detection</li>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="type3" class="content">
        <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks
           with multiple layers to analyze and learn from complex data sets. It is inspired by the structure and function of the
           human brain, allowing it to recognize patterns and make predictions based on large amounts of data.</p>
        <p>One example of deep learning in day-to-day life is voice recognition technology
          used in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.
        These systems use deep learning algorithms to understand and interpret human speech, allowing them to respond to commands and
        questions. Another example is image recognition technology used in self-driving cars to identify objects and obstacles on the road.
        The advantages of deep learning include its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data, its flexibility in adapting to
        new tasks and domains, and its potential for high accuracy in prediction and classification. However, limitations include the need
        for large amounts of labeled data for training, the computational resources required for training and inference, and the potential
        for overfitting or bias in the model.</p>
